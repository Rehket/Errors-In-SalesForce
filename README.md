### Errors in SalesForce
Errors can be thought of as any action that does not work correctly, despite the user performing the expected actions.

Errors happen frequently when you are dealing with or processing user input. So code that is close to user interface needs to be especially robust. Errors are also frequently when you are consuming data from external systems. 

Critical Areas for error handling:
- UI Logic
- Parsing User Input
- Performing Background actions while a user is entering input
- Loading records from an external database
